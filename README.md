# 4-LED_Memory_Game-MSP430
My final project for the Udemy course 'Microcontrollers and C Programming'

This is a simple memory game made with a TI MSP430-6989 Launcpad, using 4 coloured LEDs and 4 push buttons. 

It is my final project for the Udemy course 'Microcontrollers and the C Programming language', which I started about a month ago
as my first brush with programming and microcontrollers, and it has been great fun!

The code is rather simple and thoroughly commented, so if you'd like to take a look please go ahead. I'm very new to this stuff, so any
constructive criticism and advice is very welcome!
